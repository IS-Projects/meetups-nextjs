# meetups-nextjs
This repository is created based on the 23rd module of the course "React - The Complete Guide 2022" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. It goes over the way to use the framework Nextjs to create an app, and how to connect it to MongoDB. This repository contains two apps, one shows a basic set up of an app with Nextjs, and the other one shows an app that is using MongoDB as the database. That app was deployed through Vercel: https://meetups-nextjs-rho.vercel.app/.
